        The final version of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren was the SLR Stirling Moss Edition. This open-top roadster used the same carbon fibre monocoque and 5.5-litre V8 powertrain as the standard SLR, but with dramatic bodywork directly inspired by the 1955 Mille Miglia 300 SLR. Powered by the 650PS version of the 5.5-litre AMG engine used in the 722 Edition models, the SLR Stirling Moss Edition is ultra-rare, with just 75 cars built.

<P> 
    <sup>
        The SLR uses a bonded full carbon fibre monocoque, just like the McLaren F1 road car before it, and all subsequent McLaren cars. Along with the monocoque, McLaren developed carbon fibre front end crash structures which are bolted to the SLRâ€™s aluminium engine mounts, the SLR being the first road car to include this Formula 1-derived innovation. The SLR also includes a carbon fibre bodyshell while the doors and bonnet are also constructed from the lightweight material.
